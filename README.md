# monkey.nvim

This is an implementation of `monkey`, the language from the amazing
[interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com).

The implementation is in fennel for two reasons:
1. I wanted to try and write a lisp to learn something new
2. I thought it would be funny if we could run monkey programs inside of neovim

So, I'll continue tinkering with this repo on-and-off for a bit because I'm having fun.
And then after that, it seems possible that you'll be able to just run monkey files
and even write plugins in monkey -- which would be pretty fun :)
